# My Porfolio

<b>TITLE</b>: 02 CSS & Bootstrap: Responsive Portfolio

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
This repository contains the milestone homework assignment for the Coding Bootcamp conducted by the University of Birmingham, featuring my deployed portfolio as a reponsive webpage (named after myself, Maryum Bokhari, the page logo), available for employers to notice and consider me as a potential candidate for their organisation(s).

The pages created for this homework include three described below:

1. <b>About Page (index.html):</b>
    This page is all about myself, the creator of the portfolio. The page describes my life, achievements, and educational background, while also displaying images, animations and links for the websites I have created for the programming course I am currently attending at UOB. The page also contains my CV, and links to my Github and LinkedIn profiles, at the bottom of the page.

2. <b>Portfolio (portfolio.html)</b>
    This page is an illustration of different images regarding my background, my educational institutions, and my hobbies and interests, with brief descriptions of each image. It is just to describe my personality more up-close, outside my curriculum and employability aspects.

3. <b>Contact (contact.html)</b>
    Lastly, this page demonstrates a form for the viewer of my page, in case they wish to get in contact with me. The viewer must fill out the form with their full name and email address, and then submit the form by clicking on the 'Submit' button once. In case of any inconvenience, I have added some of my contact information underneath the form.

The page was successfully created using the following resources and programming tools:

1. HTML/CSS
2. Bootstrap
3. Font Awesome
4. W3Schools
5. StackOverflow
6. W3C Markup Validation Service

<b>THE 'MY PORTFOLIO' WEBSITE:</b>
Finally, after applying the styling and semantics to the code, the final website has finally been deployed via Github. The screenshot below is a representation of the repository on Github and the actual deployed website:

The following image is a depiction of how I was also able to make the website responsive:

After deploying the website, I used the following link to validate the HTML of my website, which then stated that my code is nearly 100% error-free:

<b>SUMMARY:</b>
In a nutshell, I was able to create, update, style and deploy a website of my own from scratch, with the help of all the resources made available to me by the course and by the very helpful teaching staff. My website is now available online, and can be accessed using the link below:

For further information, and for further convenience, I have included the link to my CV here in this README.md file:
