# Unit_02_CSS_Bootstrap

<b>TITLE</b>: 02 CSS & Bootstrap: Responsive Portfolio

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
This repository contains the second homework assignment for the Coding Bootcamp conducted by the University of Birmingham. This homework assignment was about creating a webpage from scratch, featuring the creator's portfolio and deploying it as a reponsive webpage.

The files submitted for this homework include three html files and one css file (and a readme file for this description). The html files are described below:

1. <b>About Page (index.html):</b>
    This page is all about myself, Maryum Bokhari, the creator of the website. The page describes my life, achievements, and educational background, with a display profile image.

2. <b>Portfolio (portfolio.html)</b>
    This page is an illustration of different images regarding my background and my educational institutions, with brief description of each image.

3. <b>Contact (contact.html)</b>
    Lastly, this page demonstrates a form for the viewer of my page, in case they wish to get in contact with me. The viewer must fill out the form with their full name and email address, and then submit the form by clicking on the 'Submit' button once.

 <i>HTML:</i>
 
 For all the three pages, the html is relatively similar, because the three html files share the following aspects:

  - The links to an external stylesheet (CSS), Bootstrap CSS, and Bootstrap JavaScript;
  - A navbar, with a logo, responsive navlinks and a responsive toggle, all coded within the header semantic tag;
  - Responsive images, and/or labels;
  - A body, with variable elements depending on the page requirements;
  - A footer, with the Copyright text and a link to my social media
