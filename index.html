            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              I, Maryum Bokhari, am a student currently working on a venture to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. I am
              a
              hardworking and determined individual, working my way to set a successful career in engineering and web
              development.
              This website provides details about my life, hobbies and ambitions that you may find interesting and
              inspiring. For more information about my lifestyle and
              background, have a look at the images in the <a href="portfolio.html">Porfolio</a> section.<br>

              <br>Originally from Pakistan, I have achieved my basic education from my hometown, Lahore, and then
              moved to England in 2016 to continue my pursuit in becoming an engineer, from Aston University. In 2020,
              I joined a Bootcamp at University of Birmingham, to learn and become an expert at coding.<br>

            <h2>My Achievements</h2>

            <p>My basic educational achievements include the following:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>8 O level subjects, passed with 2 A*'s and 6 A's, from Convent of Jesus and Mary, Lahore, Pakistan, in
                2014.</li>
              <li>3 A level subjects, passed with an A in Chemistry, and 2 B's in Mathematics and Biology, in 2016.</li>
              <li>A Chemical Enigeering Honours Degree from Aston University, in 2020.</li>
            </ul><br>

            <h2>My Programming Work</h2>

            <p>Being a student at University of Birmingham, as mentioned earlier, I learned how to code and create web
              applications, as a part of the Full-Stack Web Development course. Some such projects that I submitted as a
              part of the assessment criteria for the course included the following three, shown as examples to
              demonstrate my programming skills:</p>

            <ol>
              <li><b>The Code Quiz</b> - this is a rather entertaining and very interactive web application that asks
                coding-related questions to the user, under a time limit. It has been created by myself, and is designed
                to be very simplistic and user-friendly. Take a look:
                <br><br>

                <img src="Assets/Code-Quiz.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Code Quiz">
                <p>You may find the deployed webpage <a href="https://maryum97.github.io/04_Web-API-s_Code_Quiz/"
                    target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                <p>Check out the Github repository <a href="https://github.com/Maryum97/04_Web-API-s_Code_Quiz"
                    target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
              </li>

              <li><b>My Weather Dashboard</b> - ah, my favourite... this is the website I created for the purpose of
                checking the current and future weather forecast of any city/country around the world, made possible
                with the use of weather API's. It stores the name of any location searched, so thay you may have another
                look! Here's the forecast of Birmingham shown on my Weather Dashboard:
                <br><br>

                    href="https://github.com/Maryum97/06_Server-Side-API-s_Weather-Dashboard" target="_blank">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Check out the Github repository <a
                    href="https://maryum97.github.io/06_Server-Side-API-s_Weather-Dashboard/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li><b>"Believe." - Group Project 1</b> - this website was created by myself and three other people in my
                group. This is yet another highly simplistic and a user-friendly platform created for the purpose of
                tracking your health and wellbeing to improve your
                general lifestyle; it has made use of all front-end programming tools, including API's. The website
                consists of three web-pages, all shown in the animated GIF below:
                <br><br>

                <img src="Assets/Believe.gif" class="img-fluid" alt="Believe">

              </li>

              <li><b>"Code Crowd" - Group Project 2</b> - this social media application was created by myself and two other
                group members. This web-app is all about connecting with coders and perfecting your programming skills, via 
                posts of code snippets and screenshots. This app has been created using the MVC structure, and has made use of
                the very latest and sophisticated back-end tools - MySQL, Express, and Bycrypt, and used models, routes and handlebars.
                The usage for this web-app is demonstrated in the animated GIF below:
                <br><br>

                <img src="Assets/Code-Crowd.gif" class="img-fluid" alt="Code Crowd">

              </li>

            </ol>

            <p>In a nutshell, it is always helpful to remain up-to-date with the advancement in science and technology.
              Therefore, I
              made the decision to pursue Coding from UOB, to advance my career and prospect of getting a job in the
              STEM
              field. Not only that, but this career option has widened my perspective towards other science and
              tech-related
              fields, and how to step forth and develop one's own industry/platform, whether online or on-ground, for
              the benefit of
              oneself and for the wider community.
