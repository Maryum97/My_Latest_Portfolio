            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              I, Maryum Bokhari, am a student currently working on a venture to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. I am
              a
              hardworking and determined individual, working my way to set a successful career in engineering and web
              development.
              This website provides details about my life, hobbies and ambitions that you may find interesting and
              inspiring. For more information about my lifestyle and
              background, have a look at the images in the <a href="portfolio.html">Porfolio</a> section.<br>

              <br>Originally from Pakistan, I have achieved my basic education from my hometown, Lahore, and then
              moved to England in 2016 to continue my pursuit in becoming an engineer, from Aston University. In 2020,
              I joined a Bootcamp at University of Birmingham, to learn and become an expert at coding.<br>

            <h2>My Achievements</h2>

            <p>My basic educational achievements include the following:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>8 O level subjects, passed with 2 A*'s and 6 A's, from Convent of Jesus and Mary, Lahore, Pakistan, in
                2014.</li>
              <li>3 A level subjects, passed with an A in Chemistry, and 2 B's in Mathematics and Biology, in 2016.</li>
              <li>A Chemical Enigeering Honours Degree from Aston University, in 2020.</li>
            </ul><br>

            <h2>My Programming Work</h2>

            <p>Being a student at University of Birmingham, as mentioned earlier, I learned how to code and create web
              applications, as a part of the Full-Stack Web Development course. Some such projects that I submitted as a
              part of the assessment criteria for the course included the following three, shown as examples to
              demonstrate my programming skills:</p>

            <ol>
              <li><b>The Code Quiz</b> - this is a rather entertaining and very interactive web application that asks
                coding-related questions to the user, under a time limit. It has been created by myself, and is designed
                to be very simplistic and user-friendly. Take a look:
                <br><br>
                <img src="Assets/Code-Quiz.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Code Quiz">
                <p>You may find the deployed webpage <a href="https://maryum97.github.io/04_Web-API-s_Code_Quiz/"
                    target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                    target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
              </li>
              <li><b>My Weather Dashboard</b> - ah, my favourite... this is the website I created for the purpose of
                checking the current and future weather forecast of any city/country around the world, made possible
                with the use of weather API's. It stores the name of any location searched, so thay you may have another
                look! Here's the forecast of Birmingham shown on my Weather Dashboard:
                <br><br>

                    href="https://github.com/Maryum97/06_Server-Side-API-s_Weather-Dashboard" target="_blank">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Check out the Github repository <a
                    href="https://maryum97.github.io/06_Server-Side-API-s_Weather-Dashboard/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li><b>"Believe." - A Group Project</b> - this is a website created by myself and three other people in my
                group. This is yet another highly simplistic and a user-friendly platform created for the purpose of
                tracking your health and wellbeing to improve your
                general lifestyle; it has made use of all front-end programming tools, including API's (one of which
                served the purpose of importing nutritional value of the food we eat on a daily basis). The website
                consists of three web-pages, all shown below:
                <br><br>
                <p>The "Home" page:</p>
                <img src="Assets/Believe.-1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Home">
                <br><br>
                <p>The "My Wellbeing Goals" page:</p>
                <img src="Assets/Believe.-2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="My Wellbeing Goals">
                <br><br>
                <p>The "Nutrition Tracking" page:</p>
                <img src="Assets/Believe.-3.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Nutrition Tracking">
                <p>Yet again, you may find the deployed webpage <a href="https://maryum97.github.io/believe/index.html"
                    target="_blank">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Check out the Github repository too <a href="https://github.com/Maryum97/believe"
                    target="_blank">here</a>.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>

            It is always helpful to remain up-to-date with the advancement in science and technology. Therefore, I
            made the decision to pursue Coding from UOB, to advance my career and prospect of getting a job in the STEM
            field.
